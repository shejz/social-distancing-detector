# **OpenCV Social Distancing Detector**  

Social distancing is crucial to preventing the spread of disease. Using computer vision technology based on OpenCV and YOLO-based deep learning, we are able to estimate the social distance of people in video streams.

Social distancing is arguably the most effective nonpharmaceutical way to prevent the spread of a disease â€” by definition, if people are not close together, they cannot spread germs.
